#### Day 2: Implement Task Entity and Database Integration
**Goal**: Create the `Task` entity, set up JPA repository, and test database persistence.
**Steps**:
1. **Create Task Entity**:
   - In `com.example.scheduler`, create the `Task` class with fields (`id`, `priority`, `estimatedTimeMs`, `resourceDemand`, `actualTimeMs`, `dependencies`) as shown in the provided code.
   - Add JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `@ElementCollection`) and getters/setters.
2. **Create Task Repository**:
   - Create the `TaskRepository` interface extending `JpaRepository<Task, Integer>`.
   - Add the custom query method `findByActualTimeMsGreaterThan`.
3. **Configure Spring Boot**:
   - Create `AdvancedDynamicTaskScheduler.java` with `@SpringBootApplication`.
   - Add bean definitions for `DynamicTaskScheduler` and `PredictiveModel` (copy from provided code).
4. **Test Database Operations**:
   - Write a temporary test method in the main class to save and retrieve a `Task` object using `TaskRepository`.
   - Run the application (`mvn spring-boot:run`) and use the H2 console to verify data persistence.
5. **Handle Errors**:
   - Ensure proper exception handling for database operations (e.g., invalid data).

**How to Do It**:
- Copy the `Task` and `TaskRepository` code sections, ensuring annotations are correct.
- Use Spring Boot’s `@Autowired` to inject `TaskRepository` in a test method.
- In the H2 console, check the `TASK` table after saving a task to confirm persistence.
- Debug any issues with JPA configuration by checking logs for errors.

**Deliverable**: A functional `Task` entity and `TaskRepository` with database persistence tested.

#### Day 3: Implement Predictive Model with Apache Commons Math
**Goal**: Build the `PredictiveModel` class using linear regression for task time prediction.
**Steps**:
1. **Understand Linear Regression**:
   - Read about `SimpleRegression` in Apache Commons Math (docs: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/).
   - Note how it uses historical data to predict outcomes.
2. **Create PredictiveModel Class**:
   - Implement the `PredictiveModel` class with `SimpleRegression` and `TaskRepository` dependency.
   - Copy the `trainModel`, `predictExecutionTime`, and `updateModel` methods from the provided code.
3. **Integrate with Database**:
   - Ensure `trainModel` loads historical tasks from `TaskRepository`.
   - Test `updateModel` by saving a task with `actualTimeMs`.
4. **Test Prediction**:
   - Write a test method to simulate 10 tasks with varying `resourceDemand` and `actualTimeMs`.
   - Call `predictExecutionTime` and verify predictions improve as more data is added.
5. **Optimize**:
   - Add a fallback (e.g., `estimatedTimeMs`) if insufficient data exists (as in the code).

**How to Do It**:
- Copy the `PredictiveModel` code, ensuring `SimpleRegression` is imported correctly.
- Use a loop in a test method to create tasks with `resourceDemand` (e.g., 10–100) and random `actualTimeMs` (e.g., 500–2000ms).
- Log predictions to verify they align with input data after training.
- Handle edge cases like empty history or invalid data.

**Deliverable**: A working `PredictiveModel` that predicts task execution times using regression.

#### Day 4: Implement Task Dependency Graph and Cycle Detection
**Goal**: Build the `TaskDependencyGraph` class to manage dependencies and detect cycles.
**Steps**:
1. **Learn DFS for Cycle Detection**:
   - Review depth-first search (DFS) for detecting cycles in directed graphs (e.g., online tutorials or CLRS book).
   - Understand the role of `visited` and `recStack` sets.
2. **Create TaskDependencyGraph Class**:
   - Implement the `TaskDependencyGraph` class with `addTask` and `hasCycle` methods (copy from provided code).
   - Use a `Map<Integer, List<Integer>>` for the graph and `Set<Integer>` for tracking.
3. **Test Cycle Detection**:
   - Write a test method to create tasks with dependencies (e.g., Task 1 → Task 2, Task 2 → Task 1).
   - Call `hasCycle` and verify it detects cycles correctly.
4. **Integrate with Task Submission**:
   - Modify the `DynamicTaskScheduler` class (start implementing it) to use `TaskDependencyGraph` in `submitTask`.
   - Ensure it throws an exception for cyclic dependencies.
5. **Validate**:
   - Test with valid and invalid dependency graphs to ensure robustness.

**How to Do It**:
- Copy the `TaskDependencyGraph` code, focusing on the DFS logic in `hasCycleUtil`.
- Create test cases with 3–5 tasks, including one with a cycle (e.g., 1 → 2 → 3 → 1).
- Use `System.out.println` to trace DFS steps during testing.
- Debug any issues with graph construction or cycle detection.

**Deliverable**: A functional `TaskDependencyGraph` that detects cycles in task dependencies.

   - Create the `TaskRequest` DTO class for request parsing.
2. **Integrate Components**:
   - Ensure `TaskController` uses `DynamicTaskScheduler` to submit and query tasks.
   - Verify `submitTask` interacts with `TaskRepository`, `PredictiveModel`, and `TaskDependencyGraph`.
3. **Test API**:
   - Run the application (`mvn spring-boot:run`).
   - Use `curl` or Postman to test:
     - POST: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"priority":5,"estimatedTimeMs":1000,"resourceDemand":10,"dependencies":[]}'`
     - GET: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks`
   - Check the H2 console to confirm tasks are saved.
4. **Handle Errors**:
   - Add error handling for invalid requests (e.g., negative priority, cyclic dependencies).
5. **Validate Integration**:
   - Submit tasks with dependencies and verify predictions, execution, and persistence.

**How to Do It**:
- Copy the `TaskController` and `TaskRequest` code, ensuring `@Autowired` works for `DynamicTaskScheduler`.
